ELSOUL LABO B.V. (Headquarters: Amsterdam, Netherlands, CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki), in collaboration with the company's socially-contributive Web3 game Epics DAO (https://epics.dev/) and the global bare metal cloud platform Latitude (https://latitude.sh, Headquarters: São Paulo, Brazil), hosted a side event at Solana Breakpoint 2023 Amsterdam.

In this side event, a Solana validator hands-on session was conducted, utilizing the open-source tool 'solv' developed by ELSOUL LABO & Epics DAO. Participants had the opportunity to experience the setup and operation of a Solana validator on Latitude's bare metal cloud server.

Solana Breakpoint 2023 took place in Amsterdam from October 30 to November 3, focusing on the latest trends in Web3.

With more than 300 talks, panel discussions, workshops, and over 25 side events, the event was a hub of activity. Particularly in Solana Campus, three main stages, art installations, and project showcases were exhibited, serving as a gathering place for the community. Free shuttle buses and boats were available for access to the venue.

During the event, progress on partnerships between Solana and major cloud services like Google Cloud and AWS was announced.

Especially, the partnership with Google Cloud garnered significant attention as the large-scale data analytics platform BigQuery now supports Solana chain datasets.

Solana, known for its fast block generation speed and low-cost transaction processing, generates a massive amount of transaction data daily. Hence, the analysis of large datasets, which was challenging solely on-chain, has now been made possible with BigQuery.

The ease of access to data on Solana chain moving forward is expected to bring about innovation not only in data analysis but also in the utilization of the chain itself.

At last year’s Breakpoint 2022, a new validator client for Solana named Firedancer was announced, and it was revealed at this event that it is now operating in testnet.

Firedancer reconstructs major functionalities of Solana validator client software in C language, significantly reducing bottlenecks and enhancing validator performance.

In initial demo tests, Firedancer demonstrated a processing capability of over one million transactions per second, attracting attention.

Noteworthy is the system’s performance being linearly scalable with the increase in hardware resources, and it's anticipated that Firedancer will possess the processing capability of several million transactions.

Furthermore, initiatives to accelerate performance through the utilization of GPUs among other means are underway, and in one test, it recorded eight million transactions in one second.

Various announcements from different protocols were also made, accelerating innovation on the Solana chain.

ELSOUL LABO, Epics DAO, and Latitude collectively hosted a side event at Solana Breakpoint 2023 Amsterdam.

A hands-on session for Solana validators was conducted, utilizing the open-source 'solv' to experience actual setup and operation of Solana validators on Latitude bare-metal cloud servers.

On the day of the event, the participants were very keen on engaging with the hands-on session, and were able to set up and start operating Solana validators.

Thankfully, this hands-on session was very well-received, and we plan to host it online in the future.

solv is an open-source tool that allows for a simple 3-step setup of a Solana validator, with operations updateable with a single command. It is freely available for anyone to use at no cost.

solv is also advancing support for the aforementioned Firedancer, and in the future, it will be possible to set up a validator using Firedancer.

The tutorial video below introduces the process of easily setting up a Solana validator using solv. Utilizing the Latitude bare-metal cloud server, the validator setup is completed in just 3 steps. Additionally, it explains how you can try solv on your own using a $100 credit coupon offered through the partnership with Latitude.
