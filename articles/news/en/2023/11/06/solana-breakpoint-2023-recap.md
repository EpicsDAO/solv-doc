![Solana GameShift](/news/2023/11/06/GameShiftOpenBeta.jpg)

The open beta of the new gaming development platform "GameShift" was introduced.

GameShift provides an API that simplifies Web3 gaming development, which has traditionally been challenging due to the need to manage multiple protocols.

It is designed to allow developers to create games using Solana's fast transactions and low costs.

Specifically, it is possible to manage users, make credit card payments, and issue and manage in-game item NFTs and NFT collections starting from a non-custodial wallet. Compressed NFT technology is used internally, making it possible to mint cheaper than conventional Solana NFTs, allowing more data ownership such as turning items into NFTs, and forming an NFT market. is expected.

This platform is expected to make it easier for a greater number of developers to enter the blockchain gaming space.

Leveraging Solana's low transaction fees and high-speed transactions, the P2P payment application Sling has been launched.

Utilizing blockchain technology means there's no need to construct a ledger system from scratch, significantly reducing the development and operational costs for payment platforms.

Additionally, it offers the heightened security and transparency benefits that blockchain provides.

Sling continues to be developed to address the high fees and long transaction times typically associated with international payments.

The beta version, which is currently free to use (OPOS! Only Possible On Solana!), is now available, and you can join the waitlist via the following website.

The Render Network, renowned in the digital creation industry for its decentralized GPU rendering capabilities, offers a platform where artists can perform 3D rendering without hefty upfront GPU costs.

Resource owners with surplus GPU power can earn incentives by contributing to the network.

The migration from Ethereum to Solana equips Render Network with faster transactions and lower costs, enhancing accessibility for artists and resource providers.

The use of GPU resources for AI computations accentuates the current GPU shortage, and Render Network promotes efficient resource utilization.

The shift to Solana enables the construction of a broader digital infrastructure, poised to meet growing demands with scalability and cost-effectiveness.

The Helium Network has completed its migration to the Solana blockchain. As a decentralized network supporting IoT devices and 5G communications, Helium Network provides token incentives for users who contribute to its expansion by setting up hotspots.

Initially, Helium Network operated on its own blockchain tailored for IoT and 5G networks while managing token incentives.

Facing scalability challenges with over 400,000 hotspots and 700,000 wallets by 2021, Helium decided that the only solution was to migrate to Solana, known for its scalability (OPOS).

The technical challenges and solutions of this migration were discussed in a dedicated session.
