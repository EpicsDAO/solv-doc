ELSOUL LABO B.V. (CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki, Headquarters: Amsterdam, Netherlands, hereinafter "ELSOUL LABO") and Latitude.sh (CEO: Guilherme Soubihe Alberto, Headquarters: São Paulo, Brazil, hereinafter "Latitude") are pleased to announce a business partnership agreement aimed at enhancing the efficiency of Solana validator operations.

Through this business partnership, by combining the open-source tool "solv" developed by ELSOUL LABO, and the high-performance bare metal cloud servers provided by Latitude, it is aimed to significantly streamline the setup, operation, and upgrade processes of Solana validators, targeting further expansion, decentralization, and stabilization of the Solana blockchain.

## Background and Purpose of the Business Collaboration

In recent years, blockchain technology has rapidly evolved, contributing to decentralization and security improvements. However, the technical knowledge required to enter as a blockchain validator has hindered further decentralization and the acquisition of more participants.

ELSOUL LABO developed the open-source tool "solv" to address this issue. Solv is designed to easily start Solana validators in just three steps, and updates can be completed with a single command. This innovation significantly lowers the entry barrier for validators, which is believed to lead to the expansion, decentralization, and stabilization of the Solana platform. Furthermore, solv significantly reduces the operating cost of multiple validators and resolves team resource issues. It also provides cost reduction support during multiple validator operations in enterprise support.

On the other hand, Latitude provides high-performance bare metal cloud servers that meet the high hardware requirements demanded by Solana blockchain validators. This allows Solana validators to operate at optimal performance and cost-efficiency.

Noting the complementary nature of these technologies and services, ELSOUL LABO and Latitude jointly developed "solv2". Solv2 combines the operation support of solv with Latitude’s bare metal cloud servers to provide a solution that allows for a high-performance and cost-effective quick start of Solana validators.

With the view of further expanding, decentralizing, and enhancing the safety of the Solana blockchain, ELSOUL LABO and Latitude have established a new collaboration utilizing Latitude in infrastructure and solv in operations. Through this business collaboration, both companies aim to contribute to the dissemination and evolution of blockchain technology, and provide value to a broader range of users.

## Details of the Business Collaboration

The goal of this business collaboration is to significantly improve the setup, operation, and upgrade workflows of Solana validators by combining the open-source tool ‘solv’ developed by ELSOUL LABO, with the high-performance bare metal cloud servers provided by Latitude.

### Efficient Operational Support by solv

solv is designed to simplify the setup of Solana validators, enabling validator launch in just three steps. Additionally, updates can be completed with a single command, significantly lowering the entry barrier to validators and realizing operational efficiency.

### High-Performance Bare Metal Cloud by Latitude

Latitude’s bare metal cloud servers meet the high hardware requirements, allowing for the operation of Solana validators with optimal performance and cost efficiency. A few clicks are all that’s needed to prepare a high-performance machine and get started quickly, making the operation of validators swift and efficient.

### Collaboration between solv and Latitude

By integrating solv with Latitude's bare metal cloud servers, the setup and operation of validators become even more efficient. This collaboration facilitates cost reduction and rapid setup and operation of validators, contributing to further expansion, decentralization, and stabilization of the Solana blockchain.

Through such collaboration, ELSOUL LABO and Latitude aim to support the stable operation and expansion of the Solana blockchain, contributing to the overall development of the blockchain community.
