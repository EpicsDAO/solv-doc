ELSOUL LABO B.V. (Headquartered in Amsterdam, Netherlands, CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki) and its Web3 project Epics DAO, which supports open-source development and contributes to society through NFT card games, have jointly developed a new version of the Solana validator tool "solv", now releasing Ver.3.

With solv Ver.3, we now support almost all clouds that meet the hardware requirements for Solana validators, making it more user-friendly and higher performing.

The addition of the solv dashboard means that even beginners can easily set up and operate a validator without having to remember solv CLI commands.

Furthermore, in addition to supporting Solana's testnet, support has also been added for the mainnet and RPC servers, making it available for a wider range of users.

## Main Updates in "solv" Ver.3

- Whereas previously different versions were used depending on the cloud, solv Ver.3 now supports almost all clouds that meet the hardware requirements with a single version.
- Compatible with the latest configuration of Solana validator documentation. Unnecessary settings have been removed, improving performance. The tool automatically configures the best settings according to your hardware setup.
- A dashboard feature has been added. Previously, operation required executing multiple commands, but now all tasks can be performed through menu selection on the dashboard.
- In addition to supporting the incentive testnet, it now also supports launching mainnet validators and RPC servers.

Users of solv Ver.1 or Ver.2 should refer to the following documentation to update.

Most of the work is automated, so you can complete the update in a few simple steps within minutes.

## About Solana Validator Tool "solv"

![Solana Validator Tool - solv](/news/2024/01/23/solv3en.jpg)

solv is an open-source CLI tool designed to simplify the setup and operation of Solana validators. With solv, you can easily perform tasks such as setting up, operating, monitoring, alerting, and upgrading validators.

It is easy for those new to Solana validators, as well as for those who are already active validators, to transition to using solv and subsequently operate more smoothly and with less effort.

The main goals of solv are as follows:

### Promoting Decentralization of the Solana Network

By simplifying validator operations, more users can easily participate in the Solana network, contributing to network decentralization and a technology innovation society that leaves no one behind. As an open-source tool, it provides transparency while enabling the construction of a safe and reliable validator network.

### Reducing the Workload and Burden of Validator Operations

solv users can easily perform many settings and updates with a single command. Also, as the Solana network operates globally, validator operations are not confined to standard business hours. Even when early updates are difficult due to time zone differences or other issues, updates can be set from the solv command and completed automatically. This saves time for Solana validators with advanced technical skills, allowing them to create more societal value.

### Enhancing Resources of the Open-Source Community

Technically proficient open-source communities are encouraged to participate as validators. However, not all developers are familiar with specific blockchains, so the barrier can be surprisingly high. solv aims to lower the barrier for participation as a validator, allowing more open-source development communities to earn validator rewards and build a sustainable open-source development environment.

This tool was originally developed to improve the operational efficiency of our development team and community. However, realizing its immense value for Solana validators, the entire Solana community, and all open-source development communities, we decided to release solv as open-source, allowing all users to freely use it at no cost.

We hope you will give it a try.
