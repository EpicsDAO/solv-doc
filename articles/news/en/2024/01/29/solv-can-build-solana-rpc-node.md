ELSOUL LABO B.V. (Headquartered in Amsterdam, Netherlands, CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki) and its Web3 project supporting open-source development, Epics DAO, which contributes to society through NFT card games, have jointly developed a new version, v3.1.0, of the open-source Solana validator tool, 'solv'.

With solv v3.1.0, it's now possible to launch not only Solana validators but also RPC nodes on the Solana Mainnet.

## Launching Solana Mainnet RPC Nodes with 'solv' v3.1.0

By setting up your own Solana RPC Node, Solana dApps (Web3 apps utilizing Solana blockchain) can handle transactions more reliably and quickly.

Since there are usage limitations on Solana's Mainnet RPC (api.mainnet-beta.solana.com), Solana dApps developers might consider using RPC API endpoint services.

As the scale of Solana dApps grows, the limitations and congestion of RPC endpoint calls can become a problem. Having a dedicated RPC node can alleviate these bottlenecks and improve performance.

Most of the work is automated in solv, allowing you to set up an RPC node in just 3 simple steps. Please refer to the solv v3.1.0 release notes for more details on setting up an RPC node.

solv - v3.1.0 Release Notes: https://github.com/EpicsDAO/solv/releases/tag/v3.1.0

Even if you are using solv for the first time, you can quickly launch a Solana validator and RPC node in 3 simple steps.

For more details, please refer to the official documentation.

## About the Solana Validator Tool 'solv'

![Solana Validator Tool - solv](/news/2024/01/23/solv3en.jpg)

solv is an open-source CLI tool designed to simplify the setup and operation of Solana validators and RPC nodes. By using solv, you can easily manage validator and RPC node setup, operation, monitoring, alerts, upgrades, and other validator tasks.

solv makes it easy for new Solana validators, those setting up RPC nodes, and even those already operating as validators or managing RPC nodes to transition to using solv and subsequently manage their operations more effortlessly and smoothly.

The main aims of solv are as follows:

### Promoting the Decentralization of the Solana Network

Designed to allow more users to participate in the Solana network easily by simplifying update tasks, contributing to network decentralization and a technology innovation society that leaves no one behind. As an open-source tool, it offers transparency while building a safe and reliable validator network.

### Reducing the Hassle and Burden of Update Tasks

solv users can easily perform many settings and updates with just one command. Since the Solana network operates globally, update tasks do not always fall within reasonable working hours. Even if it's difficult to respond to updates on time due to time zone differences, you can set updates from the solv command and complete them automatically. This saves time for Solana validators with advanced skills, allowing them to create more social value.

### Strengthening the Resources of the Open Source Community

Technically adept open-source communities are encouraged to participate as validators. However, the barrier remains high as not all developers are familiar with specific blockchains. solv aims to lower this hurdle for participating as validators, enabling more open-source development communities to earn validator rewards and build a sustainable open-source development environment.

This tool was originally developed to improve operational efficiency for our development team and the entire community. However, recognizing its significant value for Solana validators, the entire Solana community, and all open-source development communities, we have released solv as an open-source tool, making it freely available to all users.

We hope you will give it a try.
