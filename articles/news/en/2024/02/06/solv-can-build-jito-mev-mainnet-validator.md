ELSOUL LABO B.V. (headquartered in Amsterdam, Netherlands, CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki) and its Web3 project aimed at supporting open-source development, Epics DAO, which develops a socially-contributing NFT card game, have jointly released a new version, v3.2.0, of their open-source Solana validator tool, "solv".

With solv v3.2.0, it's now possible to launch a custom Jito MEV client on the Solana mainnet, in addition to the standard Solana validator client, aimed at achieving higher revenue efficiency.

## Launching a Higher Revenue Efficiency Jito MEV Client is Now Possible

Previously, setting up a Jito MEV client required some specialized knowledge and numerous configurations and updates. However, with solv, most of the work is automated, allowing anyone to set up a Jito MEV client in just three simple steps.

For detailed setup instructions of the Jito MEV client, please refer to the solv v3.2.0 release notes.

Even those who are new to using solv can easily set up a Solana validator and RPC node in three simple steps. solv supports both mainnet and testnet, and works on most cloud platforms.

## About the Solana Validator Tool 'solv'

![Solana Validator Tool - solv](/news/2024/01/23/solv3en.jpg)

solv is an open-source CLI tool designed to simplify the setup and operation of Solana validators and RPC nodes. By using solv, you can easily manage validator and RPC node setup, operation, monitoring, alerts, upgrades, and other validator tasks.

solv makes it easy for new Solana validators, those setting up RPC nodes, and even those already operating as validators or managing RPC nodes to transition to using solv and subsequently manage their operations more effortlessly and smoothly.

The main aims of solv are as follows:

### Promoting the Decentralization of the Solana Network

Designed to allow more users to participate in the Solana network easily by simplifying update tasks, contributing to network decentralization and a technology innovation society that leaves no one behind. As an open-source tool, it offers transparency while building a safe and reliable validator network.

### Reducing the Hassle and Burden of Update Tasks

solv users can easily perform many settings and updates with just one command. Since the Solana network operates globally, update tasks do not always fall within reasonable working hours. Even if it's difficult to respond to updates on time due to time zone differences, you can set updates from the solv command and complete them automatically. This saves time for Solana validators with advanced skills, allowing them to create more social value.

### Strengthening the Resources of the Open Source Community

Technically adept open-source communities are encouraged to participate as validators. However, the barrier remains high as not all developers are familiar with specific blockchains. solv aims to lower this hurdle for participating as validators, enabling more open-source development communities to earn validator rewards and build a sustainable open-source development environment.

This tool was originally developed to improve operational efficiency for our development team and the entire community. However, recognizing its significant value for Solana validators, the entire Solana community, and all open-source development communities, we have released solv as an open-source tool, making it freely available to all users.

We hope you will give it a try.
