ELSOUL LABO B.V. (headquartered in Amsterdam, Netherlands, CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki) and its Web3 project aimed at supporting open-source development, Epics DAO, which develops a socially-contributing NFT card game, have jointly released a new version, v3.3.0, of their open-source Solana validator tool, "solv".

With solv v3.3.0, we have adopted pnpm, enabling faster updates. Additionally, the complex 4-step task required for the validator restart process on the 21st (mandatory for all Solana validators) can now be easily completed with a single command.

## Easier Maintenance and Faster Updates for Solana Validators

solv v3.3.0 introduces the use of pnpm for faster installation and updates. pnpm allows for installing and updating only the necessary parts, significantly reducing the time required for these processes. This efficient software installation also saves disk space.

Solana validators frequently face software update opportunities. On the 21st, a complex 4-step validator restart process for testnet recovery was announced.

Reference - About the validator restart process on the 21st: https://github.com/bartenbach/cluster_restart/blob/master/README.md

With solv v3.3.0, this validator restart process can be easily completed with a single command. By leveraging the advantages of open-source, we can streamline the work of the entire validator community, creating more social value.

For those who have already implemented solv, please see the release notes for this update.

solv - v3.3.0 Release Notes: https://github.com/EpicsDAO/solv/releases/tag/%40epics-dao%2Fsolv%403.3.0

Those considering implementing solv will find that starting and transitioning to its use is easier than expected. Currently compatible with both Solana's official client and JitoMEV's mainnets, with plans to support Firedancer. As an open-source tool, it is available for free. For more details, please see the official documentation.

## About the Solana Validator Tool 'solv'

![Solana Validator Tool - solv](/news/2024/01/23/solv3en.jpg)

solv is an open-source CLI tool designed to simplify the setup and operation of Solana validators and RPC nodes. By using solv, you can easily manage validator and RPC node setup, operation, monitoring, alerts, upgrades, and other validator tasks.

solv makes it easy for new Solana validators, those setting up RPC nodes, and even those already operating as validators or managing RPC nodes to transition to using solv and subsequently manage their operations more effortlessly and smoothly.

The main aims of solv are as follows:

### Promoting the Decentralization of the Solana Network

Designed to allow more users to participate in the Solana network easily by simplifying update tasks, contributing to network decentralization and a technology innovation society that leaves no one behind. As an open-source tool, it offers transparency while building a safe and reliable validator network.

### Reducing the Hassle and Burden of Update Tasks

solv users can easily perform many settings and updates with just one command. Since the Solana network operates globally, update tasks do not always fall within reasonable working hours. Even if it's difficult to respond to updates on time due to time zone differences, you can set updates from the solv command and complete them automatically. This saves time for Solana validators with advanced skills, allowing them to create more social value.

### Strengthening the Resources of the Open-Source Community

Technically adept open-source communities are encouraged to participate as validators. However, the barrier remains high as not all developers are familiar with specific blockchains. solv aims to lower this hurdle for participating as validators, enabling more open-source development communities to earn validator rewards and build a sustainable open-source development environment.

This tool was originally developed to improve operational efficiency for our development team and the wider community. However, believing it to be beneficial for Solana validators, the entire Solana community, and all open-source development communities, we have made solv available as an open-source tool, allowing all users to use it freely and at no cost.

We hope you will give it a try.
