## Generate Solana Validator Keys and Config

To generate keys and configuration for a Solana validator, use the following command.

_If you're participating as a testnet validator, you'll need approximately 500 Testnet SOL (Free). Please acquire Testnet SOL in advance and transfer it to the address in the generated `testnet-validator-keypair.json`'s pubkey._

(For those participating in TDS, if there's any remaining testnet SOL in the EpicsDAO wallet, we'll provide it. Please join our Discord channel for further details: https://discord.gg/Z8M8rZeX8R)

```bash
$ solv setup
```

### Solana Delegation Program

## Start Solana Validator

```bash
$ solv start
```

## Stop Solana Validator

```bash
$ solv stop
```

## Restart Solana Validator

```bash
$ solv restart
```

## Solana Validator Status

```bash
$ solv status
```

## Solana Validator Logs

```bash
$ solv log
```
