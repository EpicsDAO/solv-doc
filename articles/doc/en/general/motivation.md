description: Motivation for the development of "solv", Open-Source CLI Tool for Solana Validators
---

The Solana ecosystem is rapidly growing every day, and validators are at its core. Our teams at Epics DAO, ELSOUL LABO, and the open-source "Skeet" development community have all actively worked as Solana validators. Through this experience, we deeply understand the challenges and needs faced by Solana validators, leading to the development of "solv".

solv is an open-source CLI tool designed to simplify the setup, operation, monitoring, alerting, and upgrading tasks for Solana validators. With solv, whether you're new to the role of a Solana validator or already active, you can transition to using solv and smoothly carry out your operations with less hassle.

The three main goals of solv are as follows:

### Promoting the Decentralization of the Solana Network

By simplifying validator operations, solv is designed to make it easier for a broader range of users to participate in the Solana network. This contributes to a more decentralized network and a more inclusive technological society. With its open-source nature, it promotes a transparent, secure, and highly reliable validator network.

### Reducing the Hassles and Burdens of Validator Operations

Users of solv can easily conduct many settings and updates with a single command. Given that the Solana network operates globally, validator operations don't just fit into regular business hours. Even when early updates are challenging due to time zone differences, updates can be set and automatically completed via solv commands. By saving the time of Solana validators with advanced technical skills, these validators can create even greater societal value.

### Strengthening Open-Source Community Resources

Technically knowledgeable open-source communities are encouraged to participate as validators. However, not all developers are familiar with a specific blockchain, so there remains a substantial barrier to entry. solv aims to lower this barrier, enabling more open-source developers to earn rewards as validators and promote a sustainable open-source development environment.

Originally, this tool was developed to increase our development team and the entire community's operational efficiency. However, we believe it holds significant value for the entire Solana validator and Solana community, as well as all open-source development communities. Therefore, we've made solv open-source and freely available for all users. We encourage everyone to give it a try.
